Getting Started with Create React App

Project setup instructions
This project was bootstrapped with https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

*npm start*
Runs the app in the development mode.\ Open [https://pranayen0zvrjsivuynob.drops.nxtwave.tech] to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.\ You may also see any lint errors in the console.

*npm run build*
Builds the app for production to the build folder.\ It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

User Management Dashboard
Developed a web application where users can view, add, edit, and delete user details from a mock backend API.

Features
- Displayed all users fetched from the given API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- Implemented CRUD operations with buttons for ADD, EDIT, and DELETE
- Used CSS for responsive design
- Added error blocks for better user experience
- Implemented pagination to display users (5 per page)

Directory Structure
The project directory structure is as follows:

- src folder contains the application code
- components folder within src contains the individual components (ErrorBoundary, UserForm, UserList)
- Each component has a corresponding CSS file

Challenges and Potential Improvements
- Managing component state with minimal re-renders
- Ensuring responsive design for various devices
- Analyzing and handling potential errors for better user experience
